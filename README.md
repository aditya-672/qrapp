# QR/Barcode Scanner App

This app features a scanner that can read both QR codes and barcodes. Upon scanning, it navigates to a page displaying the scanned data, including whether itâ€™s a QR code or barcode, along with the date and time of the scan. The app also vibrates upon a successful scan and provides an option to use the torch while scanning. All scanned data is stored in Firebase. Additionally, the app includes a history feature that allows users to view and delete previously scanned QR codes and barcodes.
